## Group Project Week: Jun 19-26
### Summary of Work

### Monday, June 19th
We began with a problem: we are all foodies who love to eat at local restaurants, but existing services such as Yelp are unreliable because:
  1. Reviews can be submitted by anyone, including restaurant employees (or competitors)
  2. Businesses can pay to improve their Yelp standing or remove negative reviews
  3. Even honest reviews may be left by non-foodies (e.g. five-star reviews for fast food restaurants)
Enter **Food for My Mood**. This is a curated restaurant-review app written *by local foodies, for local foodies*.

#### MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
* searchable database of local restaurants and dishes
* ability to search by food category (e.g. hot dog, taco)
* ability to search by restaurant (and receive recommendations from the menu)
